     The reason is because components are wrappers for DOM elements.
     What does it even mean to listen for an event on a component?
     Once your component gets unwrapped into DOM elements, does the outer HTML element act as the thing you are listening for the event on?
     Is it some other element?
     How do you distinguish between listening for an event and declaring a prop you are listening for?
     (onClick as defined here is simply a property of that component.)

     There is no clear answer to any of those questions.
     It's too harsh to say that the solution is to simply not listen to events on components either.
     Fortunately, there is a workaround where we treat the event handler as a prop and pass it on to the component.
     Inside the component,
     we can then assign the event to a DOM element and set the event handler to the the value of the prop we just passed in.
     I realize that probably makes no sense, so let's walk through an example.
